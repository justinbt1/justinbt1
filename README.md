## Hi there, I'm Justin Boylan-Toomey üëã

### üè¢ Work:
Currently I lead the Machine Learning team at the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/), where we develop machine learning models and metrics to support Wellcome's mission to fund new discoveries in life, health, and wellbeing. We also support the [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/), a museum that explores the connections between medicine, life and art.

I also do pro bono data science consulting, mostly working to help third sector organisations tackle their challenges using data with [DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/).
